TırmanıCem is a fast-paced arcade-style climbing game developed in 24 hours during a game jam with the theme of sports. 

The game is designed for two players, each taking on a unique role:
One player controls the climber, navigating different available routes to reach the top.
The other player controls the mountain, attempting to stop the climber by triggering avalanches and obstacles.

Additionally, this was our first game jam project, making it a valuable learning experience in time-constrained game development and teamwork.
